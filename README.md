# Spam-Filter-Using-Regular-Expressions

## Project Description:
**Spam Filter Using Regular Expressions** is a simple web-based project that implements a spam filtering system using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The project uses regular expressions (regex) to identify common patterns associated with spam messages, such as suspicious words, email addresses, or phone numbers. It provides users with an interactive form where they can input text, and the system evaluates whether the text might be spam based on predefined regex patterns.

This project helps demonstrate the power of regular expressions in text processing and can be easily expanded to handle more complex spam filtering tasks in web applications.

## Features

- **Spam Detection**: Identifies text that matches known spam patterns such as fake phone numbers or email addresses.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a simple user interface where users can input text to be checked for spam.
- **Regex-Based Filtering**: Utilizes regular expressions for pattern matching to detect suspicious content.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage and form elements.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the form and results.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user input, regex matching, and dynamic results display.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-filter-regex.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```
   cd spam-filter-regex
   ```
3. **Open the index.html file in your browser**:
   Open the index.html file directly in your web browser. The spam filter form will be displayed.
   
**Use the Spam Filter**:

Type or paste text into the input box, and the app will check for patterns that resemble spam. If spam is detected, the app will display a message indicating that the input may be spam.

## Usage

**Text Input**: Users can enter text into a simple form.
**Spam Detection**: The app checks for spam-like content, including email addresses, phone numbers, and common spam words.
**Result Display**: The app shows whether the input is likely spam or clean based on regex matching.

## Example Patterns Detected

Suspicious email addresses (e.g., user@spam.com)
Fake phone numbers (e.g., +1 800 555 1234)
Common spam phrases (e.g., win a free iPhone)

## Future Improvements

Enhanced Spam Detection: Add more sophisticated regex patterns to detect additional spam content.
Backend Integration: Integrate with a backend API to perform more advanced spam filtering techniques, such as machine learning-based detection.
User Authentication: Allow users to save their filtered messages or reports.

### `.gitignore` File Example

If you need a `.gitignore` for this project, here's an example:

```gitignore
# Ignore node_modules if you use npm
node_modules/

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore OS-specific files
.DS_Store        # macOS
Thumbs.db        # Windows

# Ignore IDE-specific files
.vscode/          # Visual Studio Code
.idea/            # JetBrains IDEs

# Ignore temporary files
*.bak
*.tmp

This .gitignore will ensure that unnecessary files, such as IDE settings, OS-specific files, and logs, are not tracked by Git.
